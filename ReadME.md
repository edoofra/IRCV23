Project carried out for the course named “Innovazione digitale” 2023 by Fratus Edoardo, Andreocchi Mattia, Gaibotti Fabio, Bargnani Lorenzo.

## Introduction to project
What can you do with a Cubit (feel free to interpret it either as the fictional currency of the Battlestar Galactica series or the cryptocurrency backed by the 2018-bankrupted Dooga Ltd)?
How can you monetise being the author of the post with the greatest number of Impressions-equivalent metric in Friendster (a social media defunct in 2015)?
Currencies, ownership tokens (e.g., NFT), and even measures of popularity are **social contracts** which can only impact an interpersonal reality, i.e., a reality that exists within a (human) society. Digital transformation of social contracts already showed the potential for creating value.
The **objectives** of this project are:
1. To provide a computational characterisation of social contracts and interpersonal reality;
2. To critically assess already existing digital transformations of interpersonal realities for value creation;
3. To identify common themes and recipes for value creation in the digital world of other social contracts and to speculate on the possibility of further digital transformations.
